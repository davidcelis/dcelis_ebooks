# dcelis_ebooks

This is the source code behind my [Twitter eBooks bot](https://twitter.com/dcelis_ebooks). The bot has been around for a while, but I decided to stick the code on GitHub after cleaning up and ignoring certain files from git. This uses the wonderful [twitter_ebooks gem](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) and is partly based around the [provided example](https://github.com/mispy/ebooks_example).
